# Apple-TV-Quiz-Game-Starter-Kit
A quiz game starter kit for Apple TV

This is an Xcode project demonstrating how to create a simple quiz game for Apple TV using Objective C. This project was created to accompany my talk for Dallas App Developers titled, How To Make An Apple TV App (Basics & Beyond). Feel free to use the project however you see fit.
